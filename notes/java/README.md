# [1: Introduction][ci-introduction], Challenge 2

> Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever Makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

I was able to get the ["Hello World" program][source-hello-world-java] working with the help of [StackOverflow][resource-hello-world].
