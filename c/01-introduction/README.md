# [1: Introduction][ci-introduction], Challenge 2

> Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever Makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.
>
> **Do the same thing for C**. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly-linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.

I was able to get the "Hello World" program working with the help of [RIP Tutorial][resource-hello-world].
